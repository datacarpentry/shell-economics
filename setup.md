Computers with Windows operating systems do not automatically have a Unix Shell program
installed.
In this lesson, we encourage you to use an emulator included in [Git for Windows][install_shell],
which gives you access to both Bash shell commands and Git.

Once installed, you can open a terminal by running the program Git Bash from the Windows start
menu.

**For advanced users:**

As an alternative to Git for Windows you may wish to [Install the Windows Subsystem for Linux][wsl]
which gives access to a Bash shell command-line tool in Windows 10.

Please note that commands in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) may differ slightly
from those shown in the lesson or presented in the workshop.

For a Mac computer running macOS Mojave or earlier releases, the default Unix Shell is Bash.
For a Mac computer running macOS Catalina or later releases, the default Unix Shell is Zsh.
Your default shell is available via the Terminal program within your Utilities folder.

To open Terminal, try one or both of the following:
* In Finder, select the Go menu, then select Utilities.
  Locate Terminal in the Utilities folder and open it.
* Use the Mac 'Spotlight' computer search function.
  Search for: `Terminal` and press <kbd>Return</kbd>.

To check if your machine is set up to use something other than Bash,
type `echo $SHELL` in your terminal window.

If your machine is set up to use something other than Bash,
you can run it by opening a terminal and typing `bash`.

The default Unix Shell for Linux operating systems is usually Bash.
On most versions of Linux, it is accessible by running the
[Gnome Terminal][gnome-terminal] or [KDE Konsole][kde-konsole] or [xterm][xterm],
which can be found via the applications menu or the search bar.
If your machine is set up to use something other than Bash,
you can run it by opening a terminal and typing `bash`.

  <h3>Text Editor</h3>

  <p>
    When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text editor that is
    optimized for writing code, with features like automatic
    color-coding of key words. The default text editor on macOS and
    Linux is usually set to Vim, which is not famous for being
    intuitive. If you accidentally find yourself stuck in it, hit
    the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key, followed by <kbd>:</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd>+<kbd>!</kbd> 
    (colon, lower-case 'q', exclamation mark), then hitting <kbd>Return</kbd> to 
    return to the shell.
